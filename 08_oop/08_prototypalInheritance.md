# üåê Prototypal Inheritance in JavaScript

Prototypal inheritance is a core concept in JavaScript, where objects inherit properties and methods from other objects. In JavaScript, inheritance is not class-based (like in many other languages), but rather **prototype-based**.

---

## üß† What is Prototypal Inheritance?

Prototypal inheritance allows an object to inherit properties and methods from another object. When a property or method is called on an object, JavaScript checks if the object has it. If not, it looks for it in the object's prototype and continues up the prototype chain.

### Visual Example of Prototypal Inheritance

Imagine we have an object `person`, and we want a new object `employee` to inherit properties from `person`:

```javascript
// Define a base object with a property and method
let person = {
  name: 'John',
  greet: function() {
    console.log('Hello, ' + this.name);
  }
};

// Create an object 'employee' that inherits from 'person'
let employee = Object.create(person);

// Adding a new property to 'employee'
employee.job = 'Developer';

console.log(employee.name);  // Output: John (inherited from person)
console.log(employee.job);   // Output: Developer (own property)
employee.greet();           // Output: Hello, John (inherited method)
```

In this example, `employee` inherits the `greet()` method and `name` property from `person`. The `employee` object also has its own `job` property.

## üèóÔ∏è Creating Inherited Objects Using `Object.create()`

`Object.create()` is a method in JavaScript that allows you to create an object that directly inherits from another object. This method is especially useful when working with inheritance.

### Example of `Object.create()`:

```javascript
let animal = {
  speak: function() {
    console.log('Animal is making a sound');
  }
};

// Create a new object 'dog' that inherits from 'animal'
let dog = Object.create(animal);
dog.bark = function() {
  console.log('Woof!');
};

dog.speak();  // Output: Animal is making a sound (inherited)
dog.bark();   // Output: Woof! (own method)
```

Here, `dog` inherits from `animal` and can access the `speak()` method, but also has its own `bark()` method.

## üßë‚Äçüè´ Prototypal Inheritance with Constructor Functions

You can also implement inheritance using constructor functions and the prototype property. Constructor functions allow you to define reusable object templates, and the prototype property lets you add methods that all instances of the constructor will share.

### Example with Constructor Functions and Prototypal Inheritance

```javascript
function Animal(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

// Add method to the prototype of Animal
Animal.prototype.speak = function() {
  console.log(this.name + ' is speaking');
};

function Dog(name) {
  Animal.call(this, name);  // Inherit from Animal
}

// Set Dog's prototype to an instance of Animal
Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);

// Add a method to Dog's prototype
Dog.prototype.bark = function() {
  console.log(this.name + ' barks');
};

let dog = new Dog('Rex');
dog.speak();  // Output: Rex is speaking (inherited method from Animal)
dog.bark();   // Output: Rex barks (own method)
```

In this example:
1. We define a `Dog` constructor function that inherits from `Animal`.
2. The `Dog` constructor inherits all properties and methods from `Animal` through the prototype chain.
3. `Dog` also has its own method `bark()`.

## üîß Key Concepts of Prototypal Inheritance

### 1. **Prototype Chain**

The prototype chain is a series of objects that are linked together. If a property is not found on the object itself, JavaScript looks for it on the object‚Äôs prototype, then the prototype‚Äôs prototype, and so on, until it reaches `Object.prototype`.

### 2. **`Object.create()` and Prototypal Inheritance**

`Object.create()` creates a new object and sets its prototype to the object passed as an argument. It‚Äôs a cleaner and more explicit way to create objects that inherit from another object.

### 3. **Inheritance with Constructor Functions**

Constructor functions and their prototypes allow inheritance to be set up in a way where all instances of a given constructor can share methods defined on the constructor's prototype.

## üìö Example Summary

```javascript
// Base object with a method
let person = {
  name: 'Alice',
  introduce: function() {
    console.log('My name is ' + this.name);
  }
};

// Create an object that inherits from person
let teacher = Object.create(person);
teacher.subject = 'Math';
teacher.introduce();  // Output: My name is Alice (inherited method)

console.log(teacher.subject);  // Output: Math (own property)
```

## üßë‚Äçüè´ Key Takeaways

- **Prototype Chain**: Objects inherit properties and methods through a prototype chain.
- **Inheritance**: Prototypal inheritance allows objects to share functionality without duplicating it.
- **`Object.create()`**: Creates a new object that inherits from a specified prototype.
- **Constructor Functions**: Combine with prototypes to create objects that share common methods and properties.

## üèÖ Key Points

- Prototypal inheritance allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects.
- The prototype chain helps JavaScript determine where to look for properties or methods.
- Constructor functions and the `Object.create()` method are powerful tools for working with inheritance.
