# ðŸŒŸ Spread & Rest Operators in JavaScript

In JavaScript, the **spread** (`...`) and **rest** (`...`) operators are powerful tools introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6). They share the same syntax but serve different purposes depending on the context in which they are used.

---

## ðŸ”¥ What is the Spread Operator?

The **spread operator** (`...`) allows you to expand or spread elements of an iterable (like an array or object) into individual elements. Itâ€™s often used when working with arrays, objects, or function arguments.

### Syntax:

```javascript
// Array Spread
let newArray = [...oldArray];

// Object Spread
let newObject = {...oldObject};
```

### Example: Spread with Arrays

```javascript
const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
const arr2 = [4, 5, 6];

const combined = [...arr1, ...arr2];
console.log(combined);  // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

In this example, the spread operator spreads the elements of `arr1` and `arr2` into a new array.

### Example: Spread with Objects

```javascript
const person = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };
const address = { city: "Wonderland", country: "Fantasy" };

const combinedObject = { ...person, ...address };
console.log(combinedObject);
// Output: { name: "Alice", age: 25, city: "Wonderland", country: "Fantasy" }
```

Here, the properties of `person` and `address` are combined into a new object using the spread operator.

## ðŸš€ Why Use the Spread Operator?

1. **Concatenate Arrays**: Easily combine multiple arrays into one.
2. **Copy Objects/Arrays**: Create shallow copies of objects or arrays without affecting the original.
3. **Function Arguments**: Spread elements of an array as arguments in a function.

## ðŸ§© What is the Rest Operator?

The **rest operator** (`...`) is used to collect multiple values into a single array. It is primarily used in function parameters to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array.

### Syntax:

```javascript
// Function Rest Parameters
function myFunction(...args) {
  console.log(args);  // The arguments will be an array
}

// Array Rest Example
const [first, ...rest] = [1, 2, 3, 4];
console.log(rest);  // Output: [2, 3, 4]
```

### Example: Rest with Function Parameters

```javascript
function sum(...numbers) {
  return numbers.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0);
}

console.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4));  // Output: 10
```

In this case, the rest operator collects all function arguments into an array, allowing you to perform operations on them.

### Example: Rest with Array Destructuring

```javascript
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const [first, second, ...rest] = arr;

console.log(first);  // Output: 1
console.log(second);  // Output: 2
console.log(rest);    // Output: [3, 4, 5]
```

The rest operator is used here to collect all elements except the first two into the `rest` array.

## ðŸš€ Spread vs Rest Operator

Although both operators use the same syntax (`...`), they behave differently based on the context:

- **Spread**: Expands an iterable (array, object) into individual elements.
- **Rest**: Collects multiple values into a single array.

### Example: Spread vs Rest in Function Arguments

```javascript
// Spread in Function Call
const nums = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(Math.max(...nums));  // Output: 3

// Rest in Function Parameters
function logNumbers(...numbers) {
  console.log(numbers);  // Output: [1, 2, 3]
}
logNumbers(1, 2, 3);
```

In the first case, the spread operator is used to pass each element of the `nums` array as individual arguments to `Math.max()`. In the second case, the rest operator collects all the arguments passed into a single array.

## ðŸ§© Key Takeaways

1. **Spread Operator**:
   - Used to expand or spread elements of an iterable into individual elements.
   - Useful for combining arrays, copying objects, and passing function arguments.

2. **Rest Operator**:
   - Used to collect multiple elements into a single array.
   - Useful for gathering function arguments or extracting parts of an array.

### ðŸŽ‰ Recap

The spread and rest operators are two versatile tools in JavaScript that make handling arrays, objects, and function parameters much easier. **Spread** is used to expand iterables into individual elements, while **Rest** is used to collect multiple values into a single array. Understanding their differences and use cases will help you write cleaner and more efficient code.
