# üåü GSAP Basics

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started with GSAP Animations

Before jumping into more complex animations, let‚Äôs understand the fundamental concepts and the syntax that GSAP uses. GSAP is built to be intuitive, and getting started with basic animations is easy!

### üìå Key Terminology and Concepts

1. **Tween:**
   A **Tween** is the core of GSAP‚Äôs animation system. It represents a single animation, where you define the starting point, the ending point, and the duration of the animation. You can animate CSS properties, JavaScript objects, or even SVG elements.

2. **Timeline:**
   A **Timeline** allows you to group multiple tweens together in a sequence. Timelines give you control over the sequencing of animations, such as controlling the start time and order.

3. **Easing:**
   **Easing** controls how the animation progresses over time. You can create animations that accelerate or decelerate in various ways using different easing functions (e.g., **ease-in**, **ease-out**, **ease-in-out**).

4. **Duration:**
   The **duration** specifies how long the animation should take to complete. It is usually specified in seconds (`s`) or milliseconds (`ms`).

5. **Delay:**
   The **delay** specifies how much time to wait before starting the animation. This allows you to create timed sequences or staggered animations.

6. **From, To, and FromTo:**
   - **`from()`**: Animates the element from a set of properties to its current state.
   - **`to()`**: Animates the element from its current state to a set of properties.
   - **`fromTo()`**: Animates the element from one set of properties to another.

## ‚ú® Basic Syntax for GSAP Animations

Here‚Äôs how you can create your first animation with GSAP:

```javascript
// Basic "to" animation
gsap.to(".box", {
  duration: 2,           // Duration of 2 seconds
  x: 300,                // Move the element 300px along the x-axis
  opacity: 0.5,          // Set the opacity to 0.5
  ease: "power1.inOut"   // Apply easing for smooth animation
});
```

- `gsap.to()` animates an element from its current state to a new state.
- The first argument is the target element (in this case, an element with the class `.box`).
- The second argument is an object containing the properties you want to animate (e.g., `x`, `opacity`, `duration`, etc.).

### üéØ Example: Move a Box to the Right

```javascript
gsap.to(".box", {
  duration: 1,  // The animation will take 1 second
  x: 200        // The box will move 200px to the right
});
```

In this example, the `.box` element will move horizontally 200px over the course of 1 second.

## üåü Exploring Common GSAP Methods

1. **`gsap.from()`**: Starts the animation from a specific point.
   ```javascript
   gsap.from(".box", {
     duration: 1,
     opacity: 0,   // Start the box with 0 opacity
     x: -100       // Start the box 100px off to the left
   });
   ```

2. **`gsap.fromTo()`**: Combines both `from()` and `to()`, allowing you to define both the starting and ending properties.
   ```javascript
   gsap.fromTo(".box", {
     opacity: 0,   // Start with 0 opacity
     x: -100       // Start off to the left
   }, {
     duration: 2,  // Animate over 2 seconds
     opacity: 1,   // End with full opacity
     x: 200        // Move 200px to the right
   });
   ```
