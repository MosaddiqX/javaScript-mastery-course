# 🎛️ Controlling Tweens in GSAP

Once you’ve created animations using GSAP, you may want to control how they play—whether it's pausing, resuming, or reversing animations. GSAP provides robust methods to manage your tweens effectively, allowing for interactive and dynamic control over animations.

In this section, we will explore the different ways to control tweens using GSAP’s built-in methods.

---

## 🛑 Pausing Tweens

Pausing a tween stops the animation at its current point, and you can later resume it from that point. This is useful when you want to give users control over the animation or wait for an event before continuing.

### Syntax

```javascript
tween.pause();
```

### Example

```javascript
let tween = gsap.to(".box", { duration: 2, x: 200, paused: true });

document.querySelector("#startButton").addEventListener("click", () => {
  tween.play(); // Plays the animation when the button is clicked
});
```

In this example:
- The tween is initially paused, and it starts only when the user clicks the "startButton".

---

## ▶️ Playing Tweens

Playing a tween means it will start or resume from its current position (if it was paused).

### Syntax

```javascript
tween.play();
```

You can also use `play()` to restart the tween from the beginning.

---

## ⏸️ Pausing Tweens at a Specific Time

Sometimes, you may want to pause the tween at a specific time or frame. GSAP allows you to pass in a specific time to pause at.

### Syntax

```javascript
tween.pause(time);
```

### Example

```javascript
let tween = gsap.to(".box", { duration: 2, x: 200 });

document.querySelector("#pauseButton").addEventListener("click", () => {
  tween.pause(1); // Pauses the animation at the 1-second mark
});
```

---

## 🔁 Reversing Tweens

Reversing a tween means that it will animate in the opposite direction, retracing the steps of the initial animation.

### Syntax

```javascript
tween.reverse();
```

### Example

```javascript
let tween = gsap.to(".box", { duration: 2, x: 200 });

document.querySelector("#reverseButton").addEventListener("click", () => {
  tween.reverse(); // Reverses the animation when the button is clicked
});
```

This will animate the `.box` element back to its original position when the reverse button is clicked.

---

## 🔄 Restarting Tweens

If you want to restart an animation, you can use the `restart()` method. This method restarts the tween from its beginning and plays it again.

### Syntax

```javascript
tween.restart();
```

### Example

```javascript
let tween = gsap.to(".box", { duration: 2, x: 200 });

document.querySelector("#restartButton").addEventListener("click", () => {
  tween.restart(); // Restarts the animation from the beginning
});
```

---

## 🖼️ Seek Method

The `seek()` method allows you to manually set the position of a tween.

### Syntax

```javascript
tween.seek(time);
```

You can pass a specific time (in seconds) to seek to a particular point in the animation.

### Example

```javascript
let tween = gsap.to(".box", { duration: 2, x: 200 });

document.querySelector("#seekButton").addEventListener("click", () => {
  tween.seek(1); // Seeks to the 1-second mark of the animation
});
```

---

## ⏳ Tween Timeline Control

When working with timelines, controlling the entire sequence of animations is just as important. GSAP allows you to control timelines similarly to how you control individual tweens.

### Example

```javascript
let tl = gsap.timeline();

tl.to(".box1", { duration: 1, x: 100 })
  .to(".box2", { duration: 1, x: 100 });

document.querySelector("#pauseTimelineButton").addEventListener("click", () => {
  tl.pause(); // Pauses the entire timeline
});

document.querySelector("#playTimelineButton").addEventListener("click", () => {
  tl.play(); // Resumes the entire timeline
});
```

In this example:
- The entire timeline can be paused or played using buttons.

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- **Pause/Play**: You can pause or resume tweens at any point.
- **Reverse**: Reversing a tween will play it in the opposite direction.
- **Restart**: You can restart an animation from the beginning.
- **Seek**: The `seek()` method lets you jump to a specific point in the animation.
- **Timeline Control**: Timelines can also be controlled with `pause()`, `play()`, etc., for more complex animation sequences.

Next, we’ll dive into **Timelines**, where you'll learn how to chain animations together and create more advanced sequencing!
