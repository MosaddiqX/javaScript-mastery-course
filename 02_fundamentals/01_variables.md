# üéì Mastering Variables in JavaScript

Variables are fundamental building blocks in programming. In JavaScript, they allow us to store and manipulate data. This guide covers how to declare and use variables effectively.

## üî• Declaring Variables in JavaScript

### 1. **Using `var` (Old Way)**

- **`var`** is the traditional way of declaring variables in JavaScript.
- Variables declared with `var` are function-scoped and can be redeclared within the same scope.
- **Example**:
```javascript
var name = "Alice";
console.log(name); // Alice
```

### 2. **Using `let` (Modern Approach)**

- **`let`** is the recommended way to declare variables in modern JavaScript.
- It is block-scoped, meaning it is confined to the block (e.g., loops, conditions) in which it is declared.
- **Example**:
```javascript
let age = 25;
age = 30; // Reassigning value
console.log(age); // 30
```

### 3. **Using `const` (For Constants)**

- **`const`** is used to declare variables that cannot be reassigned once assigned.
- It is block-scoped, like `let`.
- **Example**:
```javascript
const birthYear = 1995;
console.log(birthYear); // 1995

// Attempting to reassign throws an error
// birthYear = 1996; // Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```

## üöÄ Best Practices for Declaring Variables

### 1. **Prefer `let` and `const` Over `var`**

- **`let`** should be your default choice for variables that may need to be reassigned.
- Use **`const`** for variables that should remain constant throughout your code.

### 2. **Naming Variables**

- **Meaningful names**: Choose descriptive names that explain the purpose of the variable.
  - Bad: `let x = 5;`
  - Good: `let userAge = 25;`
  
- **Camel Case**: Use camelCase for variable names (e.g., `firstName`, `totalAmount`).
  
- **Avoid Reserved Words**: Don't use JavaScript keywords or reserved words as variable names (e.g., `let return = 5;` is invalid).

### 3. **Declaring Variables at the Top of the Block**

- It's a good practice to declare variables at the top of the block or function to avoid hoisting issues.

## üîç Understanding Variable Scope

- **Global Scope**: Variables declared outside of functions are global and accessible throughout your code.
- **Local Scope**: Variables declared inside a function are local to that function and cannot be accessed outside it.

### Example: Global vs Local Scope
```javascript
let globalVar = "I'm global"; // Global scope

function demoScope() {
  let localVar = "I'm local"; // Local scope
  console.log(globalVar); // Accessible
  console.log(localVar); // Accessible
}

console.log(globalVar); // Accessible
console.log(localVar); // Uncaught ReferenceError: localVar is not defined
```

### ‚ö° Block Scope with `let` and `const`
```javascript
if (true) {
  let blockVar = "Inside block"; // Block-scoped
  const blockConst = "Constant"; // Block-scoped
  console.log(blockVar); // Accessible
  console.log(blockConst); // Accessible
}

console.log(blockVar); // Uncaught ReferenceError: blockVar is not defined
console.log(blockConst); // Uncaught ReferenceError: blockConst is not defined
```

## üî¢ Types of Data Stored in Variables

JavaScript variables can store various types of data:

### 1. **Primitive Types**
- **String**: Text data.
```javascript
let name = "Alice";
```
- **Number**: Numeric values (integer or floating point).
```javascript
let age = 25;
let price = 19.99;
```
- **Boolean**: True or false values.
```javascript
let isActive = true;
```
- **Null**: Represents a non-existent or invalid value.
```javascript
let person = null;
```
- **Undefined**: A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
```javascript
let value;
console.log(value); // undefined
```
- **Symbol**: A unique and immutable data type used to create unique object keys.
```javascript
let sym = Symbol('description');
```

### 2. **Reference Types**
- **Object**: A collection of key-value pairs.
```javascript
let person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 25
};
```
- **Array**: A list of values.
```javascript
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

## üåü Example: Variables in Action

### `script.js`
```javascript
// Declaring variables
let userName = "Bob";
const birthYear = 1990;
let userAge = 30;

// Using variables
let currentYear = new Date().getFullYear();
let calculatedAge = currentYear - birthYear;

console.log(`User's name is ${userName}`);
console.log(`User's age is ${userAge}`);
console.log(`Calculated age is ${calculatedAge}`);
```

### Output:
```
User's name is Bob
User's age is 30
Calculated age is 35
```

## üí° Key Takeaways
1. **`let` and `const`** are preferred over `var` for better scoping and immutability.
2. **`const`** is ideal for values that should not be reassigned.
3. Always use **descriptive variable names**.
4. Understand the concept of **variable scope** to avoid errors.
